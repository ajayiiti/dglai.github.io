In the last few years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising
new supervised learning framework capable of bringing the power of deep
representation learning to graph and relational data.

During [The Web Conference](https://www.amazon.science/conferences-and-events/the-web-conference-2020) in April, AWS deep learning scientists and engineers
George Karypis, Zheng Zhang, Minjie Wang, Da Zheng, and Quan Gan presented a
[tutorial](https://github.com/dglai/WWW20-Hands-on-Tutorial) on GNNs.

The tutorial offers an overview of how learning GNNs can be used to solve
problems such as detecting fraud and abuse (e.g., malicious accounts,
fraudulent financial transactions, fake reviews), supporting customer
recommendations (e.g., suggesting relevant products, jobs, articles, etc.), and
delivering marketing campaigns (e.g., targeting who should get a discount,
identifying influencers).

Watch the video presentation to learn more about putting GNNs to use in
learning applications, and get an introduction and training on the AWS Deep
Graph Library, a new software framework that simplifies the development of
efficient GNN-based training and inference programs.
